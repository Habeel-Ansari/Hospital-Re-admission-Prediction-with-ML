# Hospital Readmission Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict hospital readmissions within 30 days using patient data. The goal is to identify high-risk patients and improve healthcare outcomes. 

## Data
The dataset includes various features such as patient demographics, medical history, and hospital stay details.

## Methodology
The project involves several key steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features for the prediction task.
- **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
The models were able to predict hospital readmissions with moderate accuracy and need to improve significantly and get close to 95% accuracy ro make it usable.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Hospital Readmission Prediction.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.
